# Exercise 4 - Dictionary Comprehension 1
# Description: You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence
# and calculates the number of letters in each word.

# sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
# # Don't change code above ðŸ‘†
#
# # Write your code below:
#
# # for word in sentence.split():
# #     print(word)
#
# result = {word:len(word) for word in sentence.split()}
# #
# print(result)


# Exercise 5 - Dictionary Comprehension 2
# Description: You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in 
# degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.
# weather_c = {
#     "Monday": 12,
#     "Tuesday": 14,
#     "Wednesday": 15,
#     "Thursday": 14,
#     "Friday": 21,
#     "Saturday": 22,
#     "Sunday": 24,
# }
# ðŸš¨ Don't change code above ðŸ‘†


# Write your code ðŸ‘‡ below:
# How to calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit = (temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f

#weather_f = {day:(temp_c * 9/5) + 32 for (day, temp_c) in weather_c.items()}

#print(weather_f)
